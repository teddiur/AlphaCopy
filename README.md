## Start coding
- Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on. If you're submitting a bug or documentation fix, branch off of the latest ".x" branch.

```
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/1.1.x
```

If you're submitting a feature addition or change, branch off of the "master" branch.
```
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/master
```

- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, committing as you go.

- Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the test fails without your patch. Run the tests as described below.

- Push your commits to your fork on GitHub and create a pull request. Link to the issue being addressed with fixes #123 in the pull request.
```
$ git push --set-upstream fork your-branch-name
```


## Running the tests
Run the basic test suite with pytest.
```
$ pytest
```
